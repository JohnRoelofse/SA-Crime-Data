# SA Crime Data

This is my first attempt at creating a Shiny app using South African crime data. The app displays a simple line graph showing number of incidents of a particular crime between 2005 and 2014. The stats are shown at a police station level. Currently, only data for the Western Cape ("WC") are displayed. 

To run this file use the following code:
```
library(shiny)
runGitHub("SA-Crime-Data", "JohnRoelofse")
```
